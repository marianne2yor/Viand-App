# Vanilla JS App

## Learning Objectives

- Have fun building a web app that uses an API.
- Strengthen your Javascript skills.
- Gain exposure on integrating with APIs.
- Continue applying the HTML and CSS skills you have.

The primary goal here is to practice your new learned Javascript skills. Don't be afraid to fail and get lots of bugs - that's the best way to learn!

Your are expected to build something from scratch and on your own. Copying someone else's project will not serve you well. We are not here to just get good grades. We are here to learn critical skills to be able to build our own dreams - new job, our own app, our own startup. Mindlessly copying someone else's work will NOT move you towards those goals.

## Some ideas if you are feeling stuck

- What is an application that you wish you have to ease up your day to day?
- What are your interests and hobbies? Is there a specific problem or need related to your interests that could be addressed with a web application?
- Are there any common challenges or pain points people face that your application could help alleviate? Can your application simplify a process or provide a solution to a problem?

> _NOTE: Get approval of your App idea, scope, and user stories from your instructor before coding._
